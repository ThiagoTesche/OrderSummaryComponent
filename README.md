# Overview

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

<br>

## My design

![](./design/my-desktop-design.jpg)

## Where to find everything

-- The designs are inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

-- The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

-- You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

-- The css's archives are in `scss` folder.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BootStrap
- SCSS

<br>

### What I learned

Building this project, I learned about HTML semantics, CSS custom properties, Flexbox and BootStrap. I also learned how to use "@mixin", "@include" and ":root" in CSS and new way to write css. 

```css
.buttonPay{
    margin-top: 30px;
    @include font;
    font-size: 1em;

    button{
        padding: 2px 40px;
    }
}
```
<br>

### Continued development

I want to add JavaScript to can choice new options of plans.
